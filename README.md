# Musical-Dice-Game
A music generator in Python

Program that constructs and plays a random waltz according to the rules of Mozart’s game.

In 1787, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart created a dice game (Mozart’s Musikalisches Würfelspiel). In the game, you compose a two-part waltz by pasting together 32 of 272 pre-composed musical elements at random.

The waltz. The waltz consists of two parts - the minuet and the trio. Each is comprised of 16 measures, which are generated at random according to a fixed set of rules, as described below.

Minuet. The minuet consists of 16 measures. There are 176 possible Minuet measures, named M1.wav through M176.wav. To determine which one to play, roll two fair dice for each column of the following table.

Trio. The trio consists of 16 measures. There are 96 possible Trio measures named T1.wav through T96.wav. To determine which one to play, roll one fair die for each column, and use the following table.
